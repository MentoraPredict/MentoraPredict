  AI-Powered Academic Success and Student Retention Platform

  Predict academic risk, generate personalized recommendations, and empower educational institutions through intelligent analytics.


---

## Overview

MentoraPredict is an AI-powered educational platform designed to help educational institutions identify students at risk of academic failure or dropout before critical intervention opportunities are missed.

The platform combines predictive analytics, recommendation systems, academic intelligence, and performance monitoring to transform educational data into actionable insights for students, teachers, and administrators.

By leveraging modern cloud-native technologies and artificial intelligence, MentoraPredict aims to improve student retention, support academic success, and enable data-driven decision-making across educational organizations.

---

## Problem Statement

Educational institutions generate large volumes of academic data, yet identifying at-risk students often remains a reactive process.

As a result, institutions face challenges such as:

* High dropout rates
* Delayed academic interventions
* Limited visibility into student performance trends
* Lack of personalized academic guidance
* Difficulty measuring the effectiveness of support programs

MentoraPredict addresses these challenges through predictive analytics, intelligent recommendations, and early warning capabilities.

---

## System Objective

The primary objective of MentoraPredict is to provide an intelligent academic support platform capable of:

* Predicting dropout risk before critical academic decline occurs
* Generating personalized study recommendations
* Supporting educators through actionable analytics
* Improving institutional retention strategies
* Enabling proactive academic intervention

---

## Architecture Overview

MentoraPredict follows a microservices-based architecture deployed through containerized services.

The platform is organized into three primary layers:

### Frontend Layer

Provides user-facing applications for different platforms:

* Web Application (React)
* Mobile Application (React Native)
* Desktop Application (Electron)

### Backend Layer

Business capabilities are implemented through independent microservices:

* Authentication and authorization
* Academic management
* User management
* Metrics and reporting
* Recommendations
* Predictions and analytics

### Intelligence & Analytics Layer

Responsible for processing educational data and generating insights through:

* Predictive models
* Recommendation engines
* Academic analytics
* Performance indicators

### API Gateway

All client applications communicate through a centralized API Gateway.

The API Gateway is responsible for:

* Request routing
* Authentication validation
* Service discovery
* Cross-cutting concerns
* API aggregation

---

## Core Platform Capabilities

### Early Risk Detection

Identify students at risk of academic failure or dropout using predictive models.

### Personalized Recommendations

Generate study plans and academic recommendations tailored to individual student needs.

### Academic Analytics

Provide actionable metrics and dashboards for teachers and administrators.

### Intelligent Course Suggestions

Recommend academic paths based on performance history and learning trends.

### Early Alert System

Notify stakeholders when intervention opportunities are detected.

---

## Monorepo Structure

MentoraPredict uses a Turborepo-based monorepo architecture.
